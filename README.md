## Context:
This project was a fun way to test our ability to work with more than one person and to have the work evenly divided while ending with a functional website. We had to think out side the box for some of the iterations as it was similar to work we had done previously, but was not the same. It was a little tricky but in the end we got it to work.

## Learning Goals:
Write clean, DRY JavaScript using functions and iterations and use past project feedbacks to guide our refactor process.

## Wins + Challenges:
Wins: Technical Wins included: Getting all of the functions to work properly together. Almost all of the functions are tied to another function which in turn is tied to another function.
Challenges included: Getting the search bar function to work properly. It seemed that when we would fix one issues it would generate another issue.
